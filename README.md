### Rob Pike's 6 Rules of Programming

- Rule 1. You can't tell where a program is going to spend its time. Bottlenecks occur in surprising places, so don't try to second guess and put in a speed hack until you've proven that's where the bottleneck is.
- Rule 2. Measure. Don't tune for speed until you've measured, and even then don't unless one part of the code _overwhelms_ the rest.
- Rule 3. Fancy algorithms are slow when _n_ is small, and _n_ is usually small. Fancy algorithms have big constants. Until you know that _n_ is frequently going to be big, don't get fancy. (Even if _n_ does get big, use Rule 2 first.)
- Rule 4. Fancy algorithms are buggier than simple ones, and they're much harder to implement. Use simple algorithms as well as simple data structures.
- Rule 5. Data dominates. If you've chosen the right data structures and organized things well, the algorithms will almost always be self-evident. Data structures, not algorithms, are central to programming.
- Rule 6. There is no Rule 6.
